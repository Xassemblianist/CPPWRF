# Migrating from WRF to CPPWRF

CPPWRF is a port of WRF-ARW v4.8.0, not a new model. It reads your `namelist.input` and WRF's input files and writes
WRF's output files. The options it ports give WRF's numbers. This page says what stays the same, which options are
ported, what differs, and how to check CPPWRF against your own WRF runs.

## What is identical

- **Inputs:**
  - `namelist.input`, unchanged;
  - `wrfinput_d0N` and `wrfbdy_d01` from WRF's real.exe or from `cppwrf-realexe`;
  - `wrflowinp_d0N` (`sst_update = 1`) and `wrffdda_d0N` (`grid_fdda = 1`);
  - WRF's restart files (`wrfrst_d0N_<date>`);
  - the tables of WRF's `run/` directory;
  - the `input_sounding` of WRF's idealized cases.
- **Outputs:** `wrfout_d0N_<date>`, `wrfrst_d0N_<date>` and `auxhist3_d0N_<date>` (`output_diagnostics`), with
  WRF's variables, dimensions, attributes and global attributes in WRF's order. `history_outname`, `rst_outname`,
  `frames_per_outfile`, `iofields_filename` and `use_netcdf_classic` work as in WRF. Post-processing that reads
  wrfout files (wrf-python, NCL, UPP, ncview) reads CPPWRF's.
- **The numbers:**
  - `cpu-fp64` and `gpu-fp64` give every value of every variable at every output time exactly as WRF v4.8.0 real*8
    does, at tolerance 0. That holds for every configuration of the verification suite (docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md).
  - The comparison is with WRF built with gfortran 14.2 on Debian 13 and run in one process. WRF's own result
    changes with its MPI layout, its compiler and its flags. So WRF on your cluster, with 64 MPI ranks, does not
    match itself on one rank bit for bit either.
  - `gpu-fp32` is the fast mode. It differs from WRF real*8 by about as much as WRF's own real*4 build does.
- **The run directory:** `cppwrf-wrf` and `cppwrf-realexe` are drop-in replacements for `wrf.exe` and `real.exe`
  (below). They keep WRF's file names and places, the `rsl.out.0000` / `rsl.error.0000` logs with `Timing for main`
  lines, `SUCCESS COMPLETE WRF`, and a nonzero exit status on failure.

## From wrf.exe to cppwrf-wrf

| WRF | CPPWRF |
|---|---|
| `./real.exe` (or `mpirun -np N ./real.exe`) | `cppwrf-realexe` |
| `mpirun -np N ./wrf.exe` | `cppwrf-wrf --mode cpu-fp64 --threads N`, or `cppwrf-wrf --mode gpu-fp32` / `gpu-fp64` |
| `grep SUCCESS rsl.out.0000` | the same |
| `restart = .true.` with `wrfrst_d01_<date>` in the directory | the same |
| a namelist option WRF has | `cppwrf-check namelist.input`: ported, ignored or not ported, per option |

In a batch script, the change is one line:

```bash
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
cd $RUNDIR
cppwrf-wrf --mode gpu-fp32 || exit 1      # was: srun ./wrf.exe
```

CPPWRF's own files go to `cppwrf_work/` in the run directory: the translated configuration `run.ini`, `run.json` and
`diag.csv`. They are not needed afterwards. `cppwrf-wrf --dry-run` shows the translation and the command without
running.

## What differs

- **Parallelism.** A CPPWRF run is one process: OpenMP threads on the CPU, or one GPU. There is no MPI, so a domain
  must fit in one machine's memory, or in one GPU's (`cppwrf-fit` estimates it). The CPU result does not depend on
  the thread count.
- **Options without a port** stop the run at start-up with the option, the value and what is supported. They are:
  - MPI runs and moving nests;
  - vertical nest refinement, ndown.exe;
  - the urban and lake models;
  - spectral and observation nudging;
  - stochastic physics and chemistry;
  - I/O forms other than NetCDF;
  - the other schemes not listed below.

  docs/STATUS.md keeps the list current.
- **Restart files.** CPPWRF reads and writes WRF's `wrfrst` files. It can also write its own `restart_<step>.nc`
  (`cppwrf-wrf --native-restart`), which keep every bit of its state.
- **Before the drop-ins** (CPPWRF up to 1.0.0), a run needed `tools/wrf2cppwrf.py namelist.input -o run.ini` and
  wrote into `out/`, with a nested run's files in `out/d0N`. That way still works (docs/USER_GUIDE.md, "Translating
  WRF Namelists"), and the files are the same.
- **real.exe:** `cppwrf-realexe` writes real*8 files by default, as WRF's `-r8` build does. That is what gives WRF
  real*8's results. `--precision float` writes WRF's default single-precision files.

## Choosing the mode

| You want | Mode |
|---|---|
| The fastest run, for forecasts and ensembles | `gpu-fp32`. Its difference from WRF real*8 is the size of WRF real*4's. |
| WRF real*8's numbers, fast | `gpu-fp64`. It is bit-identical to WRF real*8 and about 2 to 3 times slower than FP32. |
| WRF real*8's numbers without a GPU | `cpu-fp64`. On one node it runs at about 0.6 to 0.9 times the speed of WRF real*8 on all its cores. |
| To check a GPU result | `cpu-fp64` on the same case, then `cppwrf-compare`. FP64 must be identical. |

docs/PERF.md has the measured speeds, and `cppwrf-bench` measures your machine.

## Comparing your WRF run with CPPWRF

Run CPPWRF in a copy of your WRF run directory, then compare the two sets of wrfout files:

```bash
cp -as $WRFRUN $CPPRUN          # links to the inputs and tables
rm $CPPRUN/wrfout_* $CPPRUN/wrfrst_* $CPPRUN/rsl.*
(cd $CPPRUN && cppwrf-wrf --mode cpu-fp64)
cppwrf-compare $WRFRUN $CPPRUN                       # every variable of every common frame, every domain
cppwrf-compare $WRFRUN/wrfout_d01_2026-10-12_00:00:00 $CPPRUN/wrfout_d01_2026-10-12_00:00:00 -v T,U,QVAPOR
```

For each variable, `cppwrf-compare` prints:

- the frames that differ;
- the largest absolute difference, the RMSE and the largest distance in units in the last place (ulp);
- the first differing point (frame, k, j, i).

`cppwrf-compare --exact` exits with status 1 at the first difference, and `--json` writes everything. It uses the
same comparison code as the verification suite (`tests/verify/exact.py`).

What to expect when you compare with your own WRF:

- **Your WRF is a real*8 build, run in one process** (`-np 1`, no OpenMP), built with gfortran on x86-64 without
  `-march`. Then `cpu-fp64` and `gpu-fp64` should be identical to it. If WRF was built with another gfortran than
  14.2, some vectorised loops may differ in the last bit, and those differences grow over a forecast.
- **Your WRF is the usual real*4 build, or runs with MPI.** Then expect differences of the size of WRF real*4
  against real*8: a relative L2 error of about 1e-4 to 1e-3 for U after an hour, more for W. Compare `gpu-fp32` with
  WRF real*4 by these norms, not by bits.
- **Some variables are left out of exact comparisons.** RQCBLTEN and RQIBLTEN in runs without cloud water or ice are
  uninitialised memory in WRF.

## The options CPPWRF ports

These tables are generated from the translator's own tables (`tools/gen_option_docs.py`; ctest
`docs_options_current` fails when they are stale). `cppwrf-check namelist.input` applies them to a namelist.

<!-- BEGIN generated by tools/gen_option_docs.py: do not edit by hand -->
